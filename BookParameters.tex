\textsf{\textbf{World War II and the Manhattan Project} -- a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. instein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, ``regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.'' To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered.}}

\def\AuthorBio{% 
\textsf{\textbf{Wilson J. Schmeggles} was a German-born theoretical physicist. He developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He is best known in popular culture for his rubber–ducky equivalence formula.}}
