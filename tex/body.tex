\section{The First Section}

Here is some copy for your book\footnote{Here is a footnote about this copy}.

	\CenterFigure{Albert}{Albert_Einstein1}{jpg}

Notice how this figure is in black and white when the book.tex is formatted, but color in the eBook and PDFs.

Here is a simple \Inx{indexed term}. And here I use the permuted index operator \PInx{Permuted Terms}{Indexed Thingy}, although you can also have a different index name if you need it: \PInx[This is in the Index Twice]{Permuted Terms}{Indexed Thingy2}.

\subsection*{An Unnumbered Section}

\lipsum[9-15]

\subsection*{Another Unnumbered Section}

\lipsum[16-22]

Here we'll illustrate some more indexing commands. \CompanyName{A Company Name} will be added to the Index (see zzInit.tex) as both the name alone,
and under the Companies index section. You can also do \FilmName{My Movie Name} as a file, and \ProjectName{The Cool Project} project names. Heres a final end note\footnote{This is the last one}, and one more citation \cite{Pfister2013}.
